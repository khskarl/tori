# Tori / トーリ

Tori is a work in progress game engine made for studying game engine development and modern real time rendering techniques. It uses a Physically Based Rendering workflow, OpenGL and is targeted for Linux, Windows and MacOS.

- GLFW3
- GLEW
- GLM (0.9.8.4)
- dear imgui (1.50)

On Ubuntu and derivatives, use the following command to install dependencies:

```
apt-get install libglm-dev libglew-dev libglfw3-dev
```
## Building
It uses GENie for managing the project. More info eventually.

## What does it do?
Works :')

## Why "Tori"?
The name Tori stands for bird in Japanese, represented by the kanji 鳥 (トーリ). This name was chosen because I like how 'Tori' sounds, and who doesn't like feathery flying poopers descendants from dinossaurs?
